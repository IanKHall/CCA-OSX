# Colour Contrast Analyser for macOS

The Colour Contrast Analyser (CCA) helps you determine the legibility of text and the contrast of visual elements, such as graphical controls and visual indicators.

The macOS version was developed by Cédric Trévisan based on the Windows version developed by Jun in collaboration with Steve Faulkner.
