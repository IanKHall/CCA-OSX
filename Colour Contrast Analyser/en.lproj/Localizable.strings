1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum):  Text (and images of text) have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except if the text is pure decoration.  Larger scale text (at least 18 point or 14 point bold) or images of text can have a contrast ratio of 3:1. (Level AA)

1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced): Text (and images of text) have a contrast ratio of at least 7:1, except if the text is pure decoration.  Larger scale text (at least 18 point or 14 point bold) or images of text can have a contrast ratio of 4.5:1. (Level AAA)

Note: Fonts that are extraordinarily thin or decorative are harder to read at lower contrast levels.";
